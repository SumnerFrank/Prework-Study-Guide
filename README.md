# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

My motivation for this project was the desire to succeed. I built this project to help me better understand and remember what was and what will be taught in this course. This solves the issue of needing all of my notes in once place, as well is providing some practice and understanding for the future of the course. I have learned the basics of how coding languages talk to each other, what purpose each one serves, and how to implement them with the software that I have and that has been downloaded through the prework portion of the class.
